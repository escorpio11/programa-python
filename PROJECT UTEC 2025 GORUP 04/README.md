ðŸ“Œ AI-Powered Structural Design Automation Tool
Overview
This project is a robust AI-powered automation tool designed to streamline and optimize the structural design process for buildings in Peru using ETABS, Python, and the COM API. It integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle both geometric data extraction and vision-based tasks, and provides a user-friendly interface via Streamlit. The tool enables structural engineers to generate, modify, and verify ETABS models programmatically, ensuring higher accuracy, efficiency, and repeatability in dynamic structural analysis.
